'''
To fix in c++ code:
- normalize input to -1 to 1 range
   - deadband
   - reduce top speed
- add arming sequence for ESC 
- add watchdog timer to stop motor if no commands received for a certain time


pip install adafruit-blinka adafruit-circuitpython-pca9685
pip install --upgrade Jetson.GPIO adafruit-blinka

Hook up:
nano / pca9685
 1 - (VCC comes from ESC via BEC)
 2 - V+ (for 9685 board)
 3 - SDA
 4 - open
 5 - SCL
 6 - GND

        # Deadbands - wheels just barely move when off the ground
        # forward: 0.271
        # backward: -0.0405

Control an ESC drive motor using PCA9685 on Jetson Orin Nano
- ESC is what came with the AMORIL 1/10 RTR Brushless Fast RC Car
    Arming: t.b.d., but likely set to neutral for 1 second, then forward for 1 second, then neutral again
    Switch to reverse: do arming sequence
    Switch to forward: do arming sequence
- A previous ESC is a Hyric brushless motor controller - Brush-X60-RTR
    Arming: set to neutral for 2 seconds
    Switch to reverse: set to neutral, then min pulse, then neutral again
    Switch to forward: no change needed, just set to neutral
- pwm 0 is for steering servo
- pwm 1 is for drive motor (ESC)

Control range is from -1 to 0 to 1
- Steering - -1 is full left, 0 is center, 1 is full right
- Drive - -1 is full reverse, 0 is stop, 1 is full forward

Uses adafruit_pca9685 library for PWM control

Could get fancy and use a class for each channel, but this is simpler for now.
